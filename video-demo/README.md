## Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This folder contains the video demonstration(s) of the project.

### Project Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by the irreversible scarring of liver tissue, which can lead to severe complications and liver failure if left untreated. This project aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis using advanced machine learning techniques. The video demonstration showcases the workflow, features, and results of the predictive model, highlighting its potential impact in clinical settings.
