## Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This folder contains all source code, models, datasets, and related files required to run and develop the project.

### Project Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by the irreversible scarring of liver tissue, which can lead to severe complications and liver failure if left untreated. This project aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis using advanced machine learning techniques. The developed predictive model holds promise for early detection and prognosis, enabling healthcare professionals to initiate timely interventions and personalized treatment strategies. By accurately identifying individuals at risk, this research contributes to improved patient outcomes and the optimization of healthcare resources. It also highlights the potential of machine learning in hepatology, showcasing its ability to leverage clinical data for predictive modeling and decision support.

### Contents
- Source code files (Flask app, scripts, notebooks)
- Pre-trained machine learning models (.pkl files)
- Dataset(s) used for training and testing
- Web application templates and static files
- Any additional scripts or resources required for the project

### How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Or use conda for core packages, then pip for imbalanced-learn.)
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
5. Fill in the required medical parameters and submit to get a prediction.

> **Note:** Ensure all required files (models, templates, etc.) are present in this folder for the application to work correctly.
