Revolutionizing Liver Care : Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
Revolutionizing Liver Care : Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques


Liver cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease characterized by the irreversible scarring of liver tissue, which can lead to severe complications and liver failure if left untreated. This project aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis using machine learning techniques.The developed predictive model holds promise for early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis, enabling healthcare professionals to initiate timely interventions and personalized treatment strategies. By accurately identifying individuals at risk of cirrhosis, this research contributes to improved patient outcomes and the optimization of healthcare resources. Moreover, it highlights the potential of machine learning in the field of hepatology, showcasing its ability to leverage clinical data for predictive modeling and decision support.

 

Project Flow:

Project Structure: 

Create the Project folder which contains files as shown below 

Graphical user interface, text, application

Description automatically generated

We are building a flask application which needs HTML pages stored in the templates folder and a python script app.py for scripting.

Static folder and assets folder contain the CSS and JavaScript files along with images.

rf_acc_68.pkl and normalizer.pkl are our saved models. Further we will use these models for flask integration. 

Training folder contains a model training file that are jupyter notebooks.
